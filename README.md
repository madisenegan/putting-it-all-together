# Putting-It-All-Together
The site I made for the final project, Madisen's Media, is a site for me to organize and look through my past, present, and future in books and movies. The site is made up of those three parts, all of which are hyperlinked in the navbar. 

The past section features a searchable table compiled of movies I've previously watched and books I've previously read, along with the date in which I finished them, and my own personal rating for each of the items. The present section showcases some of the books I'm currently reading, each with a progress bar to show how far I am through each book. Finally, the future section features three books/movies I hope to check out some time soon.
